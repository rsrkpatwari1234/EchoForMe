# EchoForMe

## Make learning clear and concise
EchoForMe is a Web Application that reads out the latest news to the user.It is designed especially for visually impaired people to help them by reading out the daily news to them.It is a user-friendly application that can be used by people of all generations.It seeks to address challenges faced by physically challenged people or children while learning,people who focus more on verbal concepts of teaching and also for those who wish to learn the way of recitation and pronunciation of english language words.

## Prerequisites :
- [Django](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Introduction)
- [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-django.html)
- Web Scraping
- Python programming language
- Front end development tools

## Setting Up virtual Python3 environment
1.Follow the commands to create a environemnt "env" and activate it
```
$sudo apt-get install python3.7-venv
$python3.7 -m venv env
```

2.Activate the environment using the command below
```
$source env/bin/activate
```
3.Install the required libraries in the virtual environment
```
$pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4.To deactivate the environment,use
```
$deactivate
```
## Setting up the project
1.Create a 'django_projects' directory within the same directory as the virtual environment

2.Initialise the directory for git and clone the repository

3.Refer the [cockroachDB integration article](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-django.html) to set up the database with the required tables.

4.Activate your virtual python3 environment and start the Django server using the below command
```
$python3 manage.py runserver 
```
5.Follow the URL dispalyed and you will be directed to the website

## Demo of the project
Demo of the application can be found at the youtube link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mhjo_kNuhM&feature=youtu.be 

## Future Scope
1.Enabling keyboard response (clicking keys) feature instead of clicking buttons - Much more helpful for people who have just started learning working with computers.

2.To save time in reading useless contents,we plan to add the text summarization module before creating audio files.This step will help us save both time and memory.

3.We intend to make the software much more robust and utilise other pretrained models for tts to compare their performance and use the tool that displays best performance.

4.EchoForMe can be further developed to add the recommendation feature where it can read out those news which match the interests of the user.
